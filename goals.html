      <p>
        My goal is to qualify for the Olympic Games next winter as a brakeman for Switzerland.
        I’m focused on building the speed and power it takes to compete with the best — and setting a start record would be a dream come true.
        After the Games, I plan to start driving and build my own team. I want to grow with that crew, compete at the highest level, and see how far we can go together.

        This is just the beginning — and I'm all in.
